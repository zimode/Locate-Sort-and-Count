# Locate-Sort-and-Count

Takes input from the user and tracks the number of times the same input has been entered. Each unique input is assigned a location that can be used to manage or sort the input into storage locations.  

If an invalid input was entered the line entry for that invalid item can be deleted.

When a count has been completed the counts can be cleared and reset to none.
